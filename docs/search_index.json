You may refer to an equation using Eq. \\@ref(eq:eq01). \\begin{align} (\\#eq:eq01) \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} = \\exp (\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x) \\,. \\end{align} If you want to provide a specific number to the equation, you can use \\tag{XX.XX}.

With bookdown bookdown does NOT support custom tag though. \\[\\begin{align} \\frac{p(x)}{1-p(x)} = \\exp (\\beta_0+\\beta_1 x) \\,. \\tag{3.1} \\end{align}\\] My specific label here, see eq (3.1) Color eqns using \\color{#00CC66}{...}. But sometime everything follows gets colored. You may want to use {\\color{#00CC66} ... } instead. $$ \\color{#008B45}{Y_t} = I_tI_{t-1} + (1-I_t)(1-I_{t-1}) $$ \\[\\begin{align*} {\\color{red}Y_t} = I_tI_{t-1} + (1-I_t)(1-I_{t-1}) \\end{align*}\\] This only works for color names, not hex codes starting with #, because html requires the # followed by 6 characters to define a color, but LaTeX package xcolor specifically excludes # in color specifications. Here is an (only works for LaTeX). A workaround: We can write a custom R function to insert the correct syntax depending on the output format using the is_latex_output() and is_html_output() functions in knitr as follows: colorize &lt;- function(x, color) { if (knitr::is_latex_output()) { sprintf(&quot;\\\\textcolor{%s}{%s}&quot;, color, x) } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) { sprintf(&quot;&lt;span style=&#39;color: %s;&#39;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, color, x) } else x } We can then use the code in an inline R expression `r colorize(\"some words in red\", \"red\")`, which will create some words in red, which works for both html and . Mathjax https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#mathjax-equations RStudio IDE comes with Mathjax 2.7 bundled. This is used by rmarkdown when local mode is used for example. Path is stored in Sys.getenv(\"RMARKDOWN_MATHJAX_PATH\"). &gt; Sys.getenv(&quot;RMARKDOWN_MATHJAX_PATH&quot;) [1] &quot;/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/resources/mathjax-27&quot; &gt; rmarkdown:::mathjax_config() [1] &quot;MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML&quot; For online mode, rmarkdown uses https://mathjax.rstudio.com/latest/ with config MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML for now. Default configuration used by the rmarkdown package is given by rmarkdown:::mathjax_config(). As of rmarkdown v2.1, the function returns “MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML”. This configures Mathjax to HTML-CSS. Change Mathjax configuration to CommonHTML using the following codes. --- title: &quot;Trouble with MathJax&quot; output: html_document: mathjax: &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_CHTML.js&quot; self_contained: false --- By default, MathJax scripts are included in HTML documents for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the mathjax option to control how MathJax is included: Specify \"default\" to use an HTTPS URL from a CDN host (currently provided by RStudio). Specify \"local\" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using \"local\" you also need to set the self_contained option to false. Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location. To use a self-hosted copy of MathJax. Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely. Q: Why my eqns are not rendered? A: MathJax is unlikely to work offline. Check internet connection. You load MathJax into a web page by including its main JavaScript file into the page. That is done via a &lt;script&gt;tag that links to the MathJax.js file. To do that, place the following line in the &lt;head&gt; section of your document. For example, if you are using the MathJax distributed network service, the tag might be &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; MathJax is available as a web service from cdn.mathjax.org, so you can obtain MathJax from there without needing to install it on your own server. The CDN is part of a distributed “cloud” network, so it is handled by servers around the world. That means that you should get access to a server geographically near you, for a fast, reliable connection. The CDN hosts the most current version of MathJax, as well as older versions, so you can either link to a version that stays up-to-date as MathJax is improved, or you can stay with one of the release versions so that your pages always use the same version of MathJax. Q: How to define custom macros that can be used in live equation preview in RStudio? A: Go to /Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/app/resources/mathjax-27/config/TeX-MML-AM_CHTML.js, add your custom macros as follows. MathJax.Hub.Config({ extensions: [&#39;[a11y]/accessibility-menu.js&#39;], TeX: { Macros: { // define TeX macros RR: &quot;{\\\\bf R}&quot;, bold: [&quot;{\\\\bf #1}&quot;,1], btheta: &quot;\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\theta}&quot;, bAlpha: &quot;\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\Alpha}&quot;, } }, }); For equation numbering support in bookdown::pdf_document2 you need to assign labels. Defualt behavior is not adding numbering. Use \\begin{equation}...\\end{equations} or \\begin{align}...\\end{align} environments. Use (\\#eq:eq1) or \\label{eq:eq1} to add labels. Automatically add numbering. Drawback is that rmd does not have preview of equations. Do NOT enclose the environments in double dollar signs $$. Otherwise, no label is added, but cross-references still show up. $$ do not add numbering automatically. But in bookdown::html_document2, it is ok to use $$ \\begin{equation} (\\#eq:simple-lm) \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{OLS}} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i&#39; \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \\right) . \\end{equation} $$ Then reference with \\@ref(eq:simple-lm). Use \\@ref(eq:eq1) (note this use parentheses) or the Latex command \\eqref{eq:eq1} (this uses curly braces) to cite the equation. Load the dataset and calculate the monthly return in month $r$ ($r_t$) as \\begin{equation} r_t = \\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}-1 , (\\#eq:eq1) \\end{equation} where $P_t$ is the adjusted price in month $t$. Test equation1 \\@ref(eq:eq1). Test equation2 \\eqref{eq:eq1}. "]]
