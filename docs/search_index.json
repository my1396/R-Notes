A: library(package) returns an error if the package doesn‚Äôt exist. require(package) returns FALSE if the package is not found and TRUE if the packages is loaded. require is designed for use inside other functions, such as using the value it returns in some error checking loop, as it outputs a warning and continues if the package is not found. Q: How to reload a package after updating? A: Call detach(package:pkg, unload = TRUE) or unloadNamespace first, then use library(pkg) to reload. If you use library on a package whose namespace is loaded, it attaches the exports of the already loaded namespace. So detaching and re-attaching a package may not refresh some or all components of the package, and is inadvisable. The most reliable way to completely detach a package is to restart R. For example, if we want to detach ggplot2 package, we can use detach(package:ggplot2, unload=TRUE) requireNamespace can be used to test if a package is installed and loadable because it comes back with either TRUE (if found the pkg) or FALSE (if failed to find the pkg). &gt; !requireNamespace(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) [1] FALSE &gt; !requireNamespace(&quot;ggplot3&quot;) Loading required namespace: ggplot3 Failed with error: ‚Äòthere is no package called ‚Äòggplot3‚Äô‚Äô [1] TRUE To see whether need to install some packages: # install the package if it is not available if (!requireNamespace(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) # or equivalently if (!require(&quot;devtools&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;devtools&quot;) You can also use require(devtools) to check whether the required package is available, but note that it will load the package as a side effect.

You will find the latest version of packages there. 2.3.3 Update packages Update an individual package Using install.packages install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) # update one specific package Using update.packages update.packages(oldPkgs = &quot;ggplot2&quot;) Note that you need to specify oldPkgs explicily as it is a named argument. Update ALL outdated packages ## update all installed packages in a stated library location, default to `.libPaths()` update.packages(lib.loc = .libPaths(), ask = TRUE) update.packages updates ALL outdated packages in a stated library location. That library location is given by the first argument (if not supplied it works on all known library locations for the current R session). It will ask you for every package if you want to update. To just say yes to everything, use ask = FAlSE. update.packages(ask = FALSE) Unfortunately this won‚Äôt update packages installed by devtools::install_github() Troubleshooting Q: I ran update.packages(\"ggplot2\"), but nothing happened. No output on console, no error, nothing. A: The first argument specifies the library location you want to search through (and update packages therein). update.packages(\"ggplot2\") means you want to update the packages in library location ggplot2, which is most unlikely to exist on your R installation. Q: I tried to update ggplot2 with install.packages(\"ggplot2\"), but nothing happened. A: If ggplot2 is already loaded, then you can‚Äôt install ggplot2 in the current session now. If you need to, save any objects you can‚Äôt easily recreate, and quit out of R. Then start a new R session, immediately run install.packages(\"ggplot2\"), then once finished, load the package and reload in any previously saved objects. More about update.packages: update.packages(lib.loc = NULL, repos = getOption(\"repos\"), ask = TRUE): First a list of all packages found in lib.loc is created and compared with those available at the repositories. If ask = TRUE (the default) packages with a newer version are reported and for each one the user can specify if it should be updated. If so the packages are downloaded from the repositories and installed in the respective library path (or instlib if specified). You can specify one specific package to update using update.packages(oldPkgs = \"ggplot2\"). It will check updates only for that package and ask you if you want to update. The easiest way to update an individual package is just to use install.packages. It is a one step command, compared to update.packages, which first checks and then asks. update.packages returns NULL invisibly. Be aware that some package updates may cause your previous code to stop working. For this reason, we recommend updating all your packages once at the beginning of each academic year (or semester) ‚Äì don‚Äôt do it before an assessment or deadline just in case! Updating all Packages after R update R packages are missing after updating. So you have to save the installed packages and re-install them after updating. Alternatively, installr::updateR() automatically updates R and installs your packages. ‚úÖ Here is how to do it manually. ## get packages installed packs &lt;- as.data.frame(installed.packages(.libPaths()[1]), stringsAsFactors = F) # Save to local f_name &lt;- &quot;~/Documents/R/packages.csv&quot; rownames(packs) write.csv(packs, f_name, row.names = FALSE) packs &lt;- read_csv(f_name) packs ## Re-install packages using install.packages() after updating R install.packages(packs$Package) R library path /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/library use find.package(\"ggplot2\") to find the location to where the given package is found. alternatively, you can run .libPaths() .libPaths() without an argument will return a list of all the places R will currently look for loading a package when requested. .libPaths(\"a/b/c\") with an argument will add that new directory (\"a/b/c\") to the ones R was already using. If you use that directory often enough, you may wish to add that call to .libPaths(\"a/b/c\") in your .Rprofile startup file in your home directory.

A: YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language for all programming languages. YAML stands for ‚ÄúYet Another Markup Language.‚Äù Q: What does YAML do? A: It is placed at the very beginning of the document and is read by each of Pandoc, rmarkdown, and knitr. Provide metadata of the document. located at the top of the file. adheres to the YAML format and is delimited by lines containing three three dashes (---). YAML also called header and front matter. See R Markdown YAML metadata (header) tutorial with examples by hao203 HERE for commonly used YAML metadata (header) in different R Markdown output formats. YAML can set values of the template variables, such as title, author, and date of the document. The output field is used by rmarkdown to apply the output format function rmarkdown::html_document() in the rendering process. There are two types of output formats in the rmarkdown package: documents (e.g., pdf_document), and presentations (e.g., beamer_presentation). Supported output format examples: html_document, pdf_document. R Markdown documents (html_documents) and R Notebook documents (html_notebook) are very similar; in fact, an R Notebook document is a special type of R Markdown document. The main difference is using R Markdown document (html_documents) you have to knit (render) the entire document each time you want to preview the document, even if you have made a minor change. However, using an R Notebook document (html_notebook) you can view a preview of the final document without rendering the entire document. Troubleshooting Issue: bookdown always output html, even if specified to pdf. Cause: If it produces HTML, the output format must have been provided somewhere. Fix: Check if you have a _output.yml under the root directory of your book project. If you do, you may delete it. Then bookdown will use the output field that you specified in the YAML frontmatter of your Rmd document. If there are two output formats, rmarkdown::render() defaults to use the first output type. If you want another, specify the type, e.g., rmarkdown::render(\"0100-RStudio.Rmd\", 'pdf_document'). bookdown wrappers of base markdown format bookdown output formats allow numbering and cross-referencing figures/tables/equations. It takes the format html_document2, in general, markdown_document2 is a wrapper for the base format markdown_document. With the bookdown output format, you can cross-reference sections by their ID‚Äôs using the same syntax when sections are numbered. Other bookdown output format examples for single documents: pdf_document2, beamer_presentation2, tufte_html2, word_document2. See Page 12 of the reference manual for a complete list of supported format by bookdown. What bookdown is very powerful for is that it compiles books. Book formats: HTML: gitbook html_book tufte_html_book PDF: pdf_book e-book: epub_book Many aspects of the LaTeX template used to create PDF documents can be customized using top-level YAML metadata (note that these options do NOT appear underneath the output section, but rather appear at the top level along with title, author, and so on). For example: --- title: &quot;Crop Analysis Q3 2013&quot; output: pdf_document fontsize: 11pt geometry: margin=1in --- A few available metadata variables are displayed in the following (consult the Pandoc manual for the full list): Top-level YAML Variable Description lang Document language code fontsize Font size (e.g., 10pt, 11pt, or 12pt) papersize Defines the paper size (e.g., a4paper, letterpaper) documentclass LaTeX document class (e.g., article, book, and report) classoption A list of options to be passed to the document class, e.g., you can create a two-column document with the twocolumn option. geometry Options for geometry package (e.g., margin=1in set all margins to be 1 inch) mainfont, sansfont, monofont, mathfont Document fonts (works only with xelatex and lualatex) linkcolor, urlcolor, citecolor Color for internal links (cross references), external links (link to websites), and citation links (bibliography) linestretch Options for line spacing (e.g.¬†1, 1.5, 3). Pandoc User‚Äôs Guide: https://www.uv.es/wiki/pandoc_manual_2.7.3.wiki?21 classoption onecolumn, twocolumn - Instructs LaTeX to typeset the document in one column or two columns. twoside, oneside: Specifies whether double or single sided output should be generated. The classes‚Äô article and report are single sided and the book class is double sided by default. Note that this option concerns the style of the document only. The option two side does NOT tell the printer you use that it should actually make a two-sided printout. The difference between single-sided and double-sided documents in LaTeX lies in the layout of the page margins and the orientation of the text on the page. Single-sided documents are printed on only one side of the page, with the text and images aligned to the right-hand side of the page. This type of layout is often used for brochures, flyers, and other types of promotional materials. Double-sided documents are printed on both sides of the page, with the text and images alternating between right-hand and left-hand margins. This type of layout is often used for books, reports, and other types of long-form documents. A twoside document has different margins and headers/footers for odd and even pages. The layout of a twoside book Q: Why Inner margin is narrow? A: The reason for this is that with two pages side by side, you actually have only THREE margins - the left, right and middle. The middle margin is made up from the inside margins of both pages, and so these are smaller because they add together to make the middle margin. If they were bigger, then you would end up with too much whitespace in the middle. o - outside margin i - inside margin b - binding offset Before binding: ------------------ ----------------- |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|b| | | |~~~~~~| | | |~~~~~~| | | | | |~~~~~~| | | |~~~~~~| | | | | |~~~~~~| | | |~~~~~~| | | | | |~~~~~~| | | |~~~~~~| | | | | |~~~~~~| | | |~~~~~~| | | | | |~~~~~~| | ------------------ ----------------- After binding: ------------------------------- |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|ii|~~~~~~|oooo| |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|ii|~~~~~~|oooo| |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|ii|~~~~~~|oooo| |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|ii|~~~~~~|oooo| |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|ii|~~~~~~|oooo| |oooo|~~~~~~|ii|ii|~~~~~~|oooo| ------------------------------- landscape - Changes the layout of the document to print in landscape mode. openright, openany - Makes chapters begin either only on right hand pages or on the next page available. This does not work with the article class, as it does not know about chapters. The report class by default starts chapters on the next page available and the book class starts them on right hand pages. In PDFs, you can use code, typesetting commands (e.g., \\vspace{12pt}), and specific packages from LaTeX. The header-includes option loads LaTeX packages. Note that header-includes is a top-level option that align with output. --- output: pdf_document header-includes: - \\usepackage{fancyhdr} --- \\pagestyle{fancy} \\fancyhead[LE,RO]{Holly Zaharchuk} \\fancyhead[LO,RE]{PSY 508} # Problem Set 12 Common header-includes: Chinese/Japanese support --- output: pdf_document header-includes: - \\usepackage{ctex} --- Alternatively, use extra_dependencies to list a character vector of LaTeX packages. This is useful if you need to load multiple packages: --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: [&quot;bbm&quot;, &quot;threeparttable&quot;] --- If you need to specify options when loading the package, you can add a second-level to the list and provide the options as a list: --- title: &quot;Untitled&quot; output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: caption: [&quot;labelfont={bf}&quot;] hyperref: [&quot;unicode=true&quot;, &quot;breaklinks=true&quot;] lmodern: null --- Here are some examples of LaTeX packages you could consider using within your report: pdfpages: Include full PDF pages from an external PDF document within your document. caption: Change the appearance of caption subtitles. For example, you can make the figure title italic or bold. fancyhdr: Change the style of running headers of all pages. Some output options are passed to Pandoc, such as toc, toc_depth, and number_sections. You should consult the Pandoc documentation when in doubt. --- output: pdf_document: toc: true keep_tex: true --- keep_tex: true if you want to keep intermediate TeX. Easy to debug. Defaults to false. To learn which arguments a format takes, read the format‚Äôs help page in R, e.g.¬†?html_document. Parameters We can include variables and R expressions in this header that can be referenced throughout our R Markdown document. For example, the following header defines start_date and end_date parameters, which will be reflected in a list called params later in the R Markdown document. --- title: My RMarkdown author: Yihui Xie output: html_document params: start_date: &#39;2020-01-01&#39; end_date: &#39;2020-06-01&#39; --- To access a parameter in our R code, call params$&lt;parameter name&gt;, e.g., params$start_date and params$end_date. Should I use quotes to surround the values? Whenever applicable use the unquoted style since it is the most readable. Use quotes when the value can be misinterpreted as a data type or the value contains a :. # values need quotes foo: &#39;{{ bar }}&#39; # need quotes to avoid interpreting as `dict` object foo: &#39;123&#39; # need quote to avoid interpreting as `int` object foo: &#39;yes&#39; # avoid interpreting as `boolean` object foo: &quot;bar:baz:bam&quot; # has colon, can be misinterpreted as key # values need not quotes foo: bar1baz234 bar: 123baz ref: R Markdown anatomy, R Markdown Cookbook https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-6.html 3.1.1 Render Rmd When you click the Knit button (‚áß‚åòK) in RStudio, generally two processes happen: The .Rmd file is fed to knitr, which executes all of the R code chunks and creates a new markdown (.md) document which includes the R code and its output. The .md file is then processed by pandoc which is responsible for creating the finished format, e.g., HTML, PDF, MS_Word. .md files can be directly converted to html, but .md to pdf is time-consuming. It first generates .tex, then call the LaTeX engine to convert to pdf. There is one function that can do the processes mentioned above: rmarkdown::render. rmarkdown::render(input, output_format = NULL, output_file = NULL, output_dir = NULL, output_options = NULL, output_yaml = NULL) Arguments Definition output_format - \"all\" will render all formats define within the file- Name of a format, e.g., html_document, will render to that single format- An output format object, e.g., html_document(toc = TRUE, toc_depth = 2, includes = includes(before_body = \"header.htm\")), where you can pass on the argument output_options - List of output options that can override the options specified in metadata (e.g could be used to force self_contained or mathjax = \"local\"). - Note that this is only valid when the output format is read from metadata (i.e.¬†not a custom format object passed to output_format).- output_options cannot work together with xxx_document(). output_yaml Paths to YAML files specifying output formats and their configurations. The first existing one is used. If none are found, then the function searches YAML files specified to the output_yaml top-level parameter in the YAML front matter, _output.yml or _output.yaml, and then uses the first existing one. Use example of render render(&quot;0208-Rmd-GHpage.Rmd&quot;, bookdown::pdf_document2( latex_engine = &quot;xelatex&quot;, template = &quot;latex/template.tex&quot;, includes = includes( in_header = &quot;latex/preamble.tex&quot;, before_body = &quot;latex/before_body.tex&quot;) )) # This does NOT work as `output_options` is only valid when the format is not an output format object &quot;xxx_document()&quot; render(&quot;0208-Rmd-GHpage.Rmd&quot;, bookdown::pdf_document2( latex_engine = &quot;xelatex&quot;, template = &quot;latex/template.tex&quot;), output_options = list( includes = includes( in_header = &quot;latex/preamble.tex&quot;, before_body = &quot;latex/before_body.tex&quot;) )) You can have more than one output formats for your Rmd. For example, you want both the html and pdf output. When you render the Rmd with rmarkdown::render(), it will use the first output format you specify in the YAML metadata (if it is missing, the default is html_document). do not want to use the first one, you can specify the one you want in the second argument, e.g., for an Rmd document input.Rmd with the metadata: output: html_document: toc: true pdf_document: keep_tex: true You can render it to PDF via: # Render pdf rmarkdown::render(&#39;input.Rmd&#39;, &#39;pdf_document&#39;) # Render multiple formats render(&quot;input.Rmd&quot;, c(&quot;html_document&quot;, &quot;pdf_document&quot;)) # Render all formats defined rmarkdown::render(&#39;input.Rmd&#39;, &#39;all&#39;) RStudio calls the function rmarkdown::render() to render the document in a new R session. RStudio does this to ensure reproducibility. 3.1.2 Document dependency By default, R Markdown produces standalone HTML files with no external dependencies, using data:URIs to incorporate the contents of linked scripts, stylesheets, images, and videos. This means you can share or publish the file just like you share Office documents or PDFs. If you would rather keep dependencies in external files, you can specify self_contained: false. Note that even for self-contained documents, MathJax is still loaded externally (this is necessary because of its big size). If you want to serve MathJax locally, you should specify mathjax: local and self_contained: false. One common reason to keep dependencies external is for serving R Markdown documents from a website (external dependencies can be cached separately by browsers, leading to faster page load times). In the case of serving multiple R Markdown documents you may also want to consolidate dependent library files (e.g.¬†Bootstrap, and MathJax, etc.) into a single directory shared by multiple documents. You can use the lib_dir option to do this. For example: --- title: &quot;Habits&quot; output: html_document: self_contained: false lib_dir: libs --- Loading LaTeX packages We can load additional LaTeX packages using the extra_dependencies option within the pdf_document YAML settings. This allows us to provide a list of LaTeX packages to be loaded in the intermediate LaTeX output document, e.g., --- title: &quot;Using more LaTeX packages&quot; output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: [&quot;bbm&quot;, &quot;threeparttable&quot;] --- If you need to specify options when loading the package, you can add a sub-level to the list and provide the options as a list, e.g., output: pdf_document: extra_dependencies: caption: [&quot;labelfont={bf}&quot;] hyperref: [&quot;unicode=true&quot;, &quot;breaklinks=true&quot;] lmodern: null For those familiar with LaTeX, this is equivalent to the following LaTeX code: \\usepackage[labelfont={bf}]{caption} \\usepackage[unicode=true, breaklinks=true]{hyperref} \\usepackage{lmodern} The advantage of using the extra_dependencies argument over the includes argument introduced in Section 6.1 is that you do not need to include an external file, so your Rmd document can be self-contained. Includes HTML Output You can do more advanced customization of output by including additional HTML content or by replacing the core Pandoc template entirely. To include content in the document header or before/after the document body, you use the includes option as follows: --- title: &quot;Habits&quot; output: html_document: includes: in_header: header.html # inject CSS and JavaScript code into the &lt;head&gt; tag before_body: doc_prefix.html # include a header that shows a banner or logo. after_body: doc_suffix.html # include a footer template: template.html # custom templates --- An example header.html to load a MathJax extension textmacros. &lt;script type=&quot;text/x-mathjax-config&quot;&gt; MathJax.Hub.Config({ loader: {load: [&#39;[tex]/textmacros&#39;]}, tex: {packages: {&#39;[+]&#39;: [&#39;textmacros&#39;]}} }); &lt;/script&gt; PDF Output For example, to support Chinese characters. You can use includes and preamble.tex (can be any name, contains any pre-loaded latex code you want to run before your main text code, for setting up environment, loading pkgs, define new commands ‚Ä¶ Very flexible.) In the main Rmd: --- output: pdf_document: includes: in_header: latex/preamble.tex before_body: latex/before_body.tex after_body: latex/after_body.tex --- If you want to add anything to the preamble, you have to use the includes option of pdf_document. This option has three sub-options: in_header: loading necessary packages before_body: Styling that has the highest priority (as it will be loaded latest; if you put in in_header, it might be overridden by default settings) Dedication page like ‚ÄúThe books is dedicated to ‚Ä¶‚Äù (Ê≠§‰π¶ÁåÆÁªô‚Ä¶) An example of before_body.tex: % Styling that has the highest priority \\let\\tightlist\\relax % disable `\\tightlist` \\setlength{\\abovedisplayskip}{-5pt} \\setlength{\\abovedisplayshortskip}{-5pt} % book dedication page \\thispagestyle{empty} \\begin{center} ÁåÆÁªô‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ ÂëÉÔºåÁà±Ë∞ÅË∞ÅÂêß \\end{center} The default bookdown uses \\tightlist for all bullet lists, setting itemsep=0pt and parskip=0pt, aim for ‚Äúcompact lists.‚Äù See the following definition: \\providecommand{\\tightlist}{% \\setlength{\\itemsep}{0pt}\\setlength{\\parskip}{0pt}} I personally don‚Äôt like the compact list setting, so I disable it with \\let\\tightlist\\relax. To prevent it from being overridden, I put it in before_body.tex instead of preamble.tex. after_body. Each of them takes one or multiple file paths. The file(s) specified in in_header will be added to the preamble. The files specified in before_body and after_body are added before and after the document body, respectively. \\documentclass{article} % preamble \\begin{document} % before_body % body % after_body \\end{document} In preamble.tex: \\usepackage{xeCJK} \\setCJKmainfont{Noto Sans CJK SC} Alternatively, you can use header-includes but with less flexibility to change options: --- output: pdf_document header-includes: - \\usepackage{ctex} --- Q: includes vs.¬†header-includes, which one is better to use for loading LaTeX packages? A: Another way to add code to the preamble is to pass it directly to the header-includes field in the YAML frontmatter. The advantage of using header-includesis that you can keep everything in one R Markdown document. However, if your report is to be generated in multiple output formats, we still recommend that you use the includes method, because the header-includes field is unconditional, and will be included in non-LaTeX output documents, too. By comparison, the includes option is only applied to the pdf_document format.

To use a different language engine, you can change the language name in the chunk header from r to the engine name, e.g., ```python x = &#39;hello, python world!&#39; print(x.split(&#39; &#39;)) ``` For engines that rely on external interpreters such as python, perl, and ruby, the default interpreters are obtained from Sys.which(), i.e., using the interpreter found via the environment variable PATH of the system. If you want to use an alternative interpreter, you may specify its path in the chunk option engine.path. For example, you may want to use Python 3 instead of the default Python 2, and we assume Python 3 is at /usr/bin/python3 ```{python, engine.path = &#39;/usr/bin/python3&#39;} import sys print(sys.version) ``` All outputs support markdown syntax. If the output is html, you can write in html syntax. The chunk label for each chunk is assumed to be unique within the document. This is especially important for cache and plot filenames, because these filenames are based on chunk labels. Chunks without labels will be assigned labels like unnamed-chunk-i, where i is an incremental number. Chunk label doesn‚Äôt need a tag, i.e., you only provide the value. If you prefer the form tag=value, you could also use the chunk option label explicitly, e.g., ```{r, label=&#39;my-chunk&#39;} # one code chunk example ``` You may use knitr::opts_chunk$set() to change the default values of chunk options in a document. Commonly used chunk options Complete list here. Or ?opts_chunk to get the help page. Options Definitions echo=TRUE Whether to display the source code in the output document.Use this when you want to show the output but not the code itself. eval=TRUE Whether to evaluate the code chunk. include=TRUE Whether to include the chunk output in the output document. If FALSE, nothing will be written into the output document, but the code is still evaluated and plot files are generated if there are any plots in the chunk, so you can manually insert figures later. message=TRUE Whether to preserve messages emitted by message() warning=TRUE Whether to show warnings in the output produced by warning(). results='markup' Controls how to display the text results. When results='markup' that is to write text output as-is, i.e., write the raw text results directly into the output document without any markups.Useful when priting stargazer tables. comment='##' The prefix to be added before each line of the text output. Set comment = '' remove the default ##. collapse=FALSE Whether to, if possible, collapse all the source and output blocks from one code chunk into a single block (by default, they are written to separate blocks). This option only applies to Markdown documents. fig.keep='high' How plots in chunks should be kept. high: Only keep high-level plots (merge low-level changes into high-level plots). none: Discard all plots. all: Keep all plots (low-level plot changes may produce new plots). first: Only keep the first plot. last: Only keep the last plot. If set to a numeric vector, the values are indices of (low-level) plots to keep.If you want to choose the second to the fourth plots, you could use fig.keep = 2:4 (or remove the first plot via fig.keep = -1). fig.align=\"center\" Figure alignment. fig.pos=\"H\" A character string for the figure position arrangement to be used in \\begin{figure}[]. fig.cap Figure caption. results='markup' note plural form for results. markup: Default. Mark up text output with the appropriate environments depending on the output format. For example, for R Markdown, if the text output is a character string \"[1] 1 2 3\", the actual output that knitr produces will be: ``` [1] 1 2 3 ``` In this case, results='markup' means to put the text output in fenced code blocks (```). asis: Write text output as-is, i.e., write the raw text results directly into the output document without any markups. ```{r, results=&#39;asis&#39;} cat(&quot;I&#39;m raw **Markdown** content.\\n&quot;) ``` Sometime, you encounter the following error messages when you have R codes within enumerate environment. You can‚Äôt use macro parameter character # in horizontal mode. By default, knitr prefixes R output with ##, which can‚Äôt be present in your TeX file. Solution: specify results=\"asis\" in code chunks. hold: Hold all pieces of text output in a chunk and flush them to the end of the chunk. hide (or FALSE): Hide text output. collapse=FALSE Whether to merge text output and source code into a single code block in the output. The default FALSE means R expressions and their text output are separated into different blocks. collapse = TRUE makes the output more compact, since the R source code and its text output are displayed in a single output block. The default collapse = FALSE means R expressions and their text output are separated into different blocks.

The hidden inline R code will be evaluated as an inline expression to an empty string by knitr. Then wrap the whole block within a markdown code block. The rendered output will display the verbatim R code chunk ‚Äî including backticks. R code generating the four backticks block: output_code &lt;- &quot;````markdown ```{r} plot(cars) ``` \\n````&quot; cat(output_code) Write this code in your R Markdown document: ````markdown `r &#39;&#39;````{r} plot(cars) ``` ```` or ````markdown ```{r}`r &#39;&#39;` plot(cars) ``` ```` Knit the document and the code will render like this in your output: ```{r} plot(cars) ``` This method makes use of Markdown Syntax for code. Q: What is the Markdown Syntax for code? A: Inline code use a pair of backticks, e.g., `code`. To use \\(n\\) literal backticks, use at least \\(n+1\\) backticks outside. Note that use a space to separate your outside backticks from your literal backtick(s). For example, to generate `code`, you use ``‚ê£`code`‚ê£`` (i.e., two backticks + space + one backtick + code + one backtick + space + two backticks). Note that you need to write sequentially. Plain code blocks can be written either After three or more backticks (fenced code blocks), or Can also use tildes (~) Indent the blocks by four spaces (indented code blocks) Special characters do not trigger special formatting, and all spaces and line breaks are preserved. Blank lines in the verbatim text need not begin with four spaces. Note that code blocks must be separated from surrounding text by blank lines. If the code itself contains a row of tildes or backticks, just use a longer row of tildes or backticks at the start and end: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~ code including tildes ~~~~~~~~~~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ These begin with a row of three or more tildes (~) and end with a row of tildes that must be at least as long as the starting row. A trick if you don‚Äôt want to type more than three tildes or backticks is that you just use different inner and outer symbols. ~~~markdown ```r print (&quot;hello world&quot;) ``` ~~~ Will be rendered as: ```r print (&quot;hello world&quot;) ``` A shortcut form (without braces) can also be used for specifying the language of the code block: ```haskell qsort [] = [] ``` This is equivalent to: ``` {.haskell} qsort [] = [] ``` haskell is the language class. You can add more classes, such as numberLines for adding line numbers. This shortcut form may be combined with attributes: ```haskell {.numberLines} qsort [] = [] ``` Which is equivalent to: ``` {.haskell .numberLines} qsort [] = [] ``` and &lt;pre id=&quot;mycode&quot; class=&quot;haskell numberLines&quot; startFrom=&quot;100&quot;&gt; &lt;code&gt; primes = filterPrime [2..] where filterPrime (p:xs) = p : filterPrime [x | x &lt;- xs, x `mod` p /= 0] &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; If highlighting is supported for your output format and language, then the code block above will appear highlighted, with numbered lines starting with 100, 101, and go on. primes = filterPrime [2..] where filterPrime (p:xs) = p : filterPrime [x | x Code chunks within enumerate Mind the indentation. Rstudio does not automatically adjust indentation for codes. specify results=\"asis\" if encounter You can‚Äôt use `macro parameter character #‚Äô in horizontal mode. cross references using bookdown (\\@ref{fig:scatter-plot}) might not work. Use latex references \\ref{fig:scatter-plot} (base latex) or \\autoref{fig:scatter-plot} (from hyperref package) markdown language does not work well inside latex environments. A possible workaround is use 1 and indent four spaces for contents that follow. If it is still a pain in the ass, use this solution. Basically, just copy the output from R condole and paste in Rmd.

The chunk label Must be unique within the document. This is especially important for cache and plot filenames, because these filenames are based on chunk labels. Chunks without labels will be assigned labels like unnamed-chunk-i, where i is an incremental number. Avoid spaces (‚ê£), periods ( .), and underscores (_) in chunk labels and paths. If you need separators, you are recommended to use hyphens (-) instead. knitr::opts_chunk$set() changes the default values of chunk options in a document. Unnumbered sections Add {-} at the end of the section title. # Question 1: Variance and Covariance properties {-} &lt;!-- equivalently, you can use {.unnumbered} --&gt; # Question 1: Variance and Covariance properties {.unnumbered} Note that the section won‚Äôt be numbered but will show in the TOC.

So use this method whenever possible. One exception is level 2 headings in Bookdown: By default Bookdown starts a new page for each level 2 heading. If you want to keep the style wihtout starting a new page, use an html tag. The heading won‚Äôt be numbered or included in TOC. However, a downside is that the heading won‚Äôt show up in the file outline either, making them harder to locate. &lt;h2&gt;YAML metadata&lt;/h2&gt; Knitting in the global environment rmarkdown::render(&quot;/Users/menghan/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-Norduniversitet/EK369E/Seminars/w1.rmd&quot;, envir=.GlobalEnv) Advantages: fast; load and output results in the global environment; easy to inspect afterwards. Rmd built-in themes for html output: https://rstudio4edu.github.io/rstudio4edu-book/rmd-themes.html .Rmd documents can be edited in either source or visual mode. To switch into visual mode for a given document, use the Source or Visual button at the top-left of the document toolbar (or alternatively the Cmd+Shift+F4 keyboard shortcut). Visual mode allows you to preview the effect after having compiled the markdown file. ‚ùóÔ∏èBut it modifies your code siliently, be cautions with visual mode. More user-friendly in terms of providing dropdown menus for editting. Visual mode supports both traditional keyboard shortcuts (e.g.¬†Cmd + B for bold) as well as markdown shortcuts (using markdown syntax directly). For example, enclose **bold** text in asterisks or type ## and press space to create a second level heading. One bug for Visual mode is that inside bullet points, $ is automatically escaped as \\$. In this case, use cmd+/ and choose inline math to insert an eqn. When type inline equations, first type $ then the equation, then $ at last. Do not type $$ at one time. Otherwise, they will be escaped as regular text. Comments in Rmd In both html and pdf outputs, use the following to write true comments you don‚Äôt want to show in the rendered file. &lt;!-- regular html comment --&gt; Link to an external javascript &lt;SCRIPT language=&quot;JavaScript&quot; SRC=&quot;my_jxscript.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/SCRIPT&gt; Tips: In general, you‚Äôd better leave at least one empty line between adjacent but different elements, e.g., a header and a paragraph. This is to avoid ambiguity to the Markdown renderer. For example, the - in the list below cannot be recognized as a bullet point. You need to add a black line before the bullet list. The result of 5 - 3 is 2.

The basic usage requires us to specify a bibliography file using the bibliography metadata field in YAML. For example: --- output: html_document bibliography: references.bib --- where the BibTeX database is a plain-text file with the *.bib extension that consists of bibliography entries. How to cite in text: Use @citationkey to cite references in text. To put citations in parentheses, use [@citationkey]. To cite multiple entries, separate the keys by semicolons, e.g., [@key-1; @key-2; @key-3]. To suppress the mention of the author, add a minus sign before @, e.g., [-@citationkey].

Check Lo and MacKinlay (1988, 1989) for example. Add an item to bibliography without using it By default, the bibliography will only display items that are directly referenced in the document. If you want to include items in the bibliography without actually citing them in the body text, you can define a dummy nocite metadata field and put the citations there. --- nocite: | @item1, @item2 --- 3.5.1 Bibliographies Users may also choose to use either natbib (based on bibtex) or biblatex as a ‚Äúcitation package‚Äù. In this case, the bibliographic data files need to be in the bibtex or biblatex format, and the document output format is limited to PDF. output: pdf_document: citation_package: natbib bookdown::pdf_book: citation_package: biblatex If you use matching styles (e.g., biblio-style: apa for biblatex along with csl: apa.csl for pandoc-citeproc), output to PDF and to non-PDF formats will be very similar, though not necessarily identical. Once you have one or multiple .bib files, you may use the field bibliography in the YAML metadata of your first R Markdown document (which is typically index.Rmd), and you can also specify the bibliography style via biblio-style (this only applies to PDF output), e.g., --- bibliography: [&quot;one.bib&quot;, &quot;another.bib&quot;, &quot;yet-another.bib&quot;] biblio-style: &quot;apalike&quot; link-citations: true --- The field link-citations can be used to add internal links from the citation text of the author-year style to the bibliography entry in the HTML output. For any non-PDF output format, pandoc-citeproc is the only available option. If consistency across PDF and non-PDF output formats is important, use pandoc-citeproc throughout. To change the bibliography style, you will need to specify a CSL (Citation Style Language) file in the csl metadata field, e.g., --- output: html_document bibliography: references.bib csl: biomed-central.csl --- "],["3.6-cross-references.html", "3.6 Cross References", " 3.6 Cross References 3.6.1 Using bookdown You can number and refer to an equation by adding \\begin{equation} along with a label, provided with (\\#eq:label). The position of the label matters. For single-lined equations: First write your equation, then append your label (\\#eq:label). Otherwise, your equation won‚Äôt be rendered. For multi-lined equations: append (\\#eq:label) after \\end{split}, \\end{aligned} ‚Ä¶ Note that \\begin{equation} must NOT be quoted in $$...$$ for the equation to be rendered. Otherwise, will cause ‚ÄúBad math delimiter‚Äù error at the time of tex compilation for pdf output. Might be alright for html output though. Unexpected consequence: Without the $$...$$, RStudio won‚Äôt provide previews for equations. For temporary preview in RStudio at the composing stage, you can enclose the whole math environment in $$...$$. But remember to delete them when you are done editing the equation. See this post by Kenji Sato for a more efficient workaround. You can then refer to the equation in text using \\@ref(eq:CJ). Remember to put the label in parentheses (). General syntax for other environments: \\@ref(type:label) where type is the environment being referenced, and label is the chunk label. This is an equation redered using bookdown \\begin{equation} (\\#eq:CJ) y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + e_t \\end{equation} will render as \\[\\begin{equation} y=\\beta_0 + \\beta_1x + e_t \\tag{3.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to it using eqn \\@ref(eq:CJ), e.g., see eqn (3.1).

Note that For HTML output, bookdown can only number the equations with labels. Please make sure equations without labels are not numbered by either using the equation* environment or adding \\nonumber or \\notag to your equations. Troubleshooting Issue: Bad math environment delimiter on conversion to pdf when using equation or align. Cause: The error happens because I enclosed \\begin{equation} environment in $$.

A workaround: We can write a custom R function to insert the correct syntax depending on the output format using the is_latex_output() and is_html_output() functions in knitr as follows: colorize &lt;- function(x, color) { if (knitr::is_latex_output()) { sprintf(&quot;\\\\textcolor{%s}{%s}&quot;, color, x) } else if (knitr::is_html_output()) { sprintf(&quot;&lt;span style=&#39;color: %s;&#39;&gt;%s&lt;/span&gt;&quot;, color, x) } else x } We can then use the code in an inline R expression `r colorize(\"some words in red\", \"red\")`, which will create some words in red, which works for both html and . Mathjax https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#mathjax-equations Default configuration used by the rmarkdown package is given by rmarkdown:::mathjax_config(). As of rmarkdown v2.1, the function returns ‚ÄúMathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML‚Äù. This configures Mathjax to HTML-CSS. Change Mathjax configuration to CommonHTML using the following codes. --- title: &quot;Trouble with MathJax&quot; output: html_document: mathjax: &quot;https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.5/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_CHTML.js&quot; self_contained: false --- By default, MathJax scripts are included in HTML documents for rendering LaTeX and MathML equations. You can use the mathjax option to control how MathJax is included: Specify \"default\" to use an HTTPS URL from a CDN host (currently provided by RStudio). Specify \"local\" to use a local version of MathJax (which is copied into the output directory). Note that when using \"local\" you also need to set the self_contained option to false. Specify an alternate URL to load MathJax from another location. To use a self-hosted copy of MathJax. Specify null to exclude MathJax entirely. Q: Why my eqns are not rendered? A: MathJax is unlikely to work offline. Check internet connection. You load MathJax into a web page by including its main JavaScript file into the page. That is done via a &lt;script&gt;tag that links to the MathJax.js file. To do that, place the following line in the &lt;head&gt; section of your document. For example, if you are using the MathJax distributed network service, the tag might be &lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt; MathJax is available as a web service from cdn.mathjax.org, so you can obtain MathJax from there without needing to install it on your own server. The CDN is part of a distributed ‚Äúcloud‚Äù network, so it is handled by servers around the world. That means that you should get access to a server geographically near you, for a fast, reliable connection. The CDN hosts the most current version of MathJax, as well as older versions, so you can either link to a version that stays up-to-date as MathJax is improved, or you can stay with one of the release versions so that your pages always use the same version of MathJax. For equation numbering support in bookdown::pdf_document2 you need to assign labels. Defualt behavior is not adding numbering. Use \\begin{equation}...\\end{equations} or \\begin{align}...\\end{align} environments. Use (\\#eq:eq1) or \\label{eq:eq1} to add labels. Automatically add numbering. Drawback is that rmd does not have preview of equations. Do NOT enclose the environments in double dollar signs $$. Otherwise, no label is added, but cross-references still show up. $$ do not add numbering automatically. But in bookdown::html_document2, it is ok to use $$ \\begin{equation} (\\#eq:simple-lm) \\hat{\\beta}_{\\text{OLS}} = \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i x_i&#39; \\right)^{-1} \\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n x_i y_i \\right) . \\end{equation} $$ Then reference with \\@ref(eq:simple-lm). Use \\@ref(eq:eq1) (note this use parentheses) or the Latex command \\eqref{eq:eq1} (this uses curly braces) to cite the equation. Load the dataset and calculate the monthly return in month $r$ ($r_t$) as \\begin{equation} r_t = \\frac{P_t-P_{t-1}}{P_{t-1}} = \\frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}}-1 , (\\#eq:eq1) \\end{equation} where $P_t$ is the adjusted price in month $t$.

Environment Printed Name Label Prefix theorem Theorem thm lemma Lemma lem corollary Corollary cor proposition Proposition prp conjecture Conjecture cnj definition Definition def example Example exm exercise Exercise exr hypothesis Hypothesis hyp Definition : an explanation of the mathematical meaning of a word. Theorem : A statement that has been proven to be true. Proposition : A less important but nonetheless interesting true statement. Lemma: A true statement used in proving other true statements (that is, a less important theorem that is helpful in the proof of other results). Lemmas are considered to be less important than propositions. But the distinction between categories is rather blurred. There is no formal distinction among a lemma, a proposition, and a theorem. Corollary: A true statment that is a simple deduction from a theorem or proposition. Proof: The explanation of why a statement is true. Conjecture: A statement believed to be true, but for which we have no proof. (a statement that is being proposed to be a true statement). Axiom: A basic assumption about a mathematical situation. (a statement we assume to be true). Usage Theorems and proofs provide environments that are commonly used within articles and books in mathematics. To write a theorem, you can use the syntax below: ```{theorem, label, name=&quot;Theorem name&quot;} Here is my first theorem. ``` will be rendered as: Theorem 3.1 (Theorem name) Here is my first theorem. Refer to the theorem using \\@ref(thm:label), e.g., see theorem 3.1. Another example ```{theorem, thm-py, name=&quot;Pythagorean theorem&quot;} For a right triangle, if $c$ denotes the length of the hypotenuse and $a$ and $b$ denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\begin{align*} c^2 = a^2+b^2 \\end{align*} ``` will be rendered as: Theorem 3.2 (Pythagorean theorem) For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[\\begin{align*} c^2 = a^2+b^2 \\end{align*}\\] Variants of the theorem environments include: lemma, corollary, proposition, conjecture, definition, example, and exercise. The syntax for these environments is similar to the theorem environment, e.g., ```{lemma}. The proof environment behaves similarly to theorem environments but is unnumbered. Variants of the proof environments include remark and solution. The proofenvironment behaves similarly to theorem environments but is unnumbered. Customize math environment labels You need to create a file _bookdown.yml in the same directory as your .Rmd. In the configuration file _bookdown.yml For example, if you want FIGURE x.x instead of Figure x.x, you can change fig to \"FIGURE \": language: label: fig: &quot;FIGURE &quot; If you want to number proof, choose one of the predefined theorem like environments that you are not using otherwise, e.g.¬†example or exercise. Redefine the printed name for that environment in _bookdown.yml (c.f. https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/internationalization.html) via: language: label: exr: &#39;Proof &#39; Here I changed the exercise environment leading word to ‚ÄúProof‚Äù. In your Rmd files use {exercise, mylabel} environment. ```{exercise, mylabel} my comment ``` In Remark \\@ref(exr:mylabel) we discussed...

You can let the code output to document directly, but you cannot scale with out.width=\"20%\" easily. The text would be scaled unexpectedly too small. ```{r car-plot, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, out.width=&quot;20%&quot;, fig.cap=&quot;Caption here.&quot; } knitr::include_graphics(img1_path) ``` Specify code chunk options fig.width and fig.height for R-generated figures only. Default is fig.width = 7 and fig.height = 5 (in inches, though actual width will depend on screen resolution). Remember that these settings will default to rmarkdown values, not knitr values. If don‚Äôt know what size is suitable, can right-click the Plots Viewer and choose ‚ÄúCopy Image Address‚Äù. Scale by /100 and fill the values to chunk options. out.width and out.height apply to both existing images and R-generated figures. note that the percentage need to be put in quotes. fig.width do not scale font, it shows the original font size. out.width scales the whole figure. Better to use this one. If you want to fix aspect ratio, use fig.asp=0.6 to set height:width = 6:10. outwidth keeps the original aspect ratio of the figure and scale the text in the figure too. But what most people want is to scale the figure but not the text. For instance, you want to scale your figure to 70% width of page, but you want to keep the original size of text so it is readable. A caveat with outwidthis that the axis labels and ticks will be so small and hard to read. fig.cap=NULL specify figure captions. Must provide fig.cap if you need to cross reference the figure. See Fig. \\@ref(fig:car-plot) use code chunk label to cross reference. The chunk label (car-plot) provides the identifier for referencing the figure generated by the chunk. Fig.&amp;nbsp;\\@ref(fig:logit-regression) use &amp;nbsp; to insert a non-breaking space. fig.align=\"center\" to set figure alignment. fig.pos=\"H\" fix placement. fig.asp=0.6 aspect ratio height:width=6:10. Suggested practice so that you have correct aspect ratio and automatically scaled text and labels in figures. ‚úÖ Generate the figure and save to local The benefit is that you have full control to adjust the figure as needed, such as font size, and could reuse it later. ```{r echo=FALSE, include=FALSE} p &lt;- ggplot(contingency_table %&gt;% as_tibble() %&gt;% mutate(chd69=factor(chd69, levels=c(&quot;non-developed&quot;, &quot;developed&quot;))), aes(x=smoke, y=n, fill=chd69)) + geom_bar(position=&quot;stack&quot;, stat=&quot;identity&quot;, color=&quot;black&quot;, linewidth=0.1) + scale_fill_grey(start=0.88, end=0.7) + labs(y=&quot;Frequency&quot;) + theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), legend.position = &quot;bottom&quot;) f_name &lt;- &quot;images/stacked_bar.png&quot; plot_png(p, f_name, 5.17, 5) ``` Specify chunk options include=FALSE (Do not include code output) to suppress the graphic window information like the following. ## quartz_off_screen ## 2 Add the figure using ```{r scatter-plot, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=&quot;Scatter plot of avearge wage against experience.&quot;, out.width = &quot;80%&quot;} include_graphics(f_name) ``` Cross reference pdf_document: using \\autoref{fig:scatter-plot} from hyperref package or Fig. \\ref{fig:scatter-plot} from base latex. hyperref uses Figure, could be changed to Fig. by putting the following cmd at the begin of the Rmd. \\renewcommand\\figureautorefname{Fig.} bookdown::html_document2: using \\@ref(fig:scatter-plot). Latex symbols in Fig. caption The R code block approach. \\\\Phi works. You need to escape the \\ in \\Phi . If there are quotation marks (\") in the figure caption, need to escape them using \\\"...\\\" to distinguish from the outer quotes of the caption parameter. You can use regular Markdown syntax in Fig captions, such as using **Bold** to make text bold. Better to use R code blocks to include figures. Note that include_graphics(\"https://link-to-Google-drive\") does NOT work for pdf output. Works for html output though. If using html tag &lt;figure&gt;, the numbering will be messed up. There is only automatic numbering with R code figures. Use example: ```{r fig.cap=&quot;The $\\\\Phi$ and $\\\\phi$ ($f_Z(.)$) functions (CDF and pdf of standard normal).&quot;, out.width=&quot;70%&quot;, echo=FALSE} include_graphics(&quot;images/Phi_b.png&quot;) ``` Will generate the following Fig 3.1. Figure 3.1: The \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) (\\(f_Z(.)\\)) functions (CDF and pdf of standard normal). Alternatively, use the HTML approach, and enclose the caption inside &lt;figcaption&gt;. Benefit: You can type equations as you normally do. Don‚Äôt need to escape backslashes as using the R code blocks in the example above. Drawback: You need to manually add figure numbering. ‚ùóÔ∏èThat means, when you change the order of sections or figures in your webpage, the numbering will be a mess. You need to change all capitals manually. &lt;figure&gt; &lt;img src=&quot;https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1nxfdIKXgZvOqXVSeA3h_hf0yxmsM361l&amp;sz=w1000&quot; alt=&quot;Phi_b&quot; style=&quot;display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;&quot; /&gt; &lt;figcaption&gt;Fig.1 The $\\Phi$ and $\\phi$ ($f_Z(.)$) functions (CDF and pdf of standard normal).&lt;/figcaption&gt; &lt;/figure&gt; Fig.1 The \\(\\Phi\\) and \\(\\phi\\) (\\(f_Z(.)\\)) functions (CDF and pdf of standard normal). Refer to another figure in figure caption Just need to use double backslash \\\\@ref(fig:xxx) in the figure caption.

Note that when specifying out.width=\"60%\", the text in the figure is scaled too small. Now a second plot with a reference to Fig.: 3.2. ```{r secondplot, fig.cap = &quot;This is the same as Fig.: \\\\@ref(fig:firstplot) but now with a red line.&quot; } plot_A + geom_line(alpha = .75,col = &quot;red&quot;) ``` Figure 3.3: This is the same as Fig.: 3.2 but now with a red line and out.width=\"100%\".

In order to number the table, mut specify the caption argument. format Possible values are latex, html, pipe (Pandoc‚Äôs pipe tables), simple (Pandoc‚Äôs simple tables), rst, and jira. The value of this argument will be automatically determined if the function is called within a knitr document. digits Maximum number of digits for numeric columns, passed to round(). col.names Rename columns. escape=TRUE Whether to escape special characters when producing HTML or LaTeX tables. Default is TRUE, special characters will either be escaped or substituted. For example, $ is escaped as \\$, _ is escaped as \\_, and \\ is substituted with \\textbackslash{} When set to FALSE, you have to make sure yourself that special characters will not trigger syntax errors in LaTeX or HTML. Common special LaTeX characters include #, %, &amp;, {, and }. Common special HTML characters include &amp;, &lt;, &gt;, and \". You need to be cautious when generating tables with escape = FALSE, and make sure you are using the special characters in the right way. It is a very common mistake to use escape = FALSE and include % or _ in column names or the caption of a LaTeX table without realizing that they are special. align Column alignment: a character vector consisting of 'l' (left), 'c' (center) and/or 'r' (right). By default or if align = NULL, numeric columns are right-aligned, and other columns are left-aligned. If only one character is provided, that will apply to all columns. If a vector is provided, will map to each individual column specifically. Missing values (NA) in the table are displayed as NA by default. If you want to display them with other characters, you can set the option knitr.kable.NA, e.g.¬†options(knitr.kable.NA = '') in the YAML to hide NA values. booktabs = TRUE use the booktabs package linesep = \"\" remove the extra space after every five rows in kable output (with booktabs option) # For Markdown tables, use `pipe` format &gt; knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), format=&quot;pipe&quot;) | | mpg| cyl| disp| hp| |:-----------------|----:|---:|----:|---:| |Mazda RX4 | 21.0| 6| 160| 110| |Mazda RX4 Wag | 21.0| 6| 160| 110| |Datsun 710 | 22.8| 4| 108| 93| |Hornet 4 Drive | 21.4| 6| 258| 110| |Hornet Sportabout | 18.7| 8| 360| 175| |Valiant | 18.1| 6| 225| 105| # For Plain tables in txt, `simple` is useful &gt; knitr::kable(head(mtcars[, 1:4]), &quot;simple&quot;) mpg cyl disp hp ------------------ ----- ---- ----- ---- Mazda RX4 21.0 6 160 110 Mazda RX4 Wag 21.0 6 160 110 Datsun 710 22.8 4 108 93 Hornet 4 Drive 21.4 6 258 110 Hornet Sportabout 18.7 8 360 175 Valiant 18.1 6 225 105 3.10.2 Data frame printing To show the tibble information (number of row/columns, and group information) along with paged output, we can write a custom function by modifying the print.paged_df function (which is used internally by rmarkdown for the df_print feature) and use CSS to nicely format the output. https://stackoverflow.com/a/76014674/10108921 Paged df https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/html-document.html#tab:paged https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1403 --- title: &quot;Use caption with df_print set to page&quot; date: &quot;2025-04-15&quot; output: bookdown::html_document2: df_print: paged --- When the df_print option is set to paged, tables are printed as HTML tables with support for pagination over rows and columns.

Passing a regression object creates a nice regression table. stargaer does not work with anova table, use pander::pander instead. Text table ```{r descrptive-analysis-text, comment = &#39;&#39;} apply(data[,-1], 2, get_stat) %&gt;% stargazer(type = &quot;text&quot;, digits=2) ``` HTML table, note that need to specify results=\"asis\". *‚Äôs do not show properly, need to specify as footnote manually. ```{r descrptive-analysis-html, results=&quot;asis&quot;} apply(data[,-1], 2, get_stat) %&gt;% stargazer(type = &quot;html&quot;, digits=2, notes = &quot;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#42;&lt;/span&gt;: p&lt;0.1; &lt;span&gt;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;0.05&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;span&gt;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&lt;/span&gt;: p&lt;0.01 &lt;br&gt; Standard errors in the parentheses.&quot;, notes.append = F) ``` type specify output table format. Possible values: latex (default for latex code), html, and text. Need to specify to html in html outputs. digits an integer that indicates how many decimal places should be used. A value of NULL indicates that no rounding should be done at all, and that all available decimal places should be reported. Defaults to 3 digits. notes a character vector containing notes to be included below the table. notes.append=FALSE a logical value that indicates whether notes should be appended to the standard note(s) associated with the table‚Äôs style (typically an explanation of significance cutoffs). Defaults to TRUE. If the argument‚Äôs value is set to FALSE, the character strings provided in notes will replace any existing/default notes. Add a blank line under the stargazer table: &amp;nbsp; with a blank line above and below. Cross reference stargazer tables. In pdf output, use Table \\@ref(tab:reg-table) or Table \\ref{tab:reg-table}. Table \\@ref(tab:reg-table) summarize the regression results in a table. ```{r, include=TRUE, results=&#39;asis&#39;} stargazer(capm_ml, FF_ml, type=&#39;latex&#39;, header=FALSE, digits=4, no.space = TRUE, title=&quot;Regression Results for META&quot;, label = &quot;tab:reg-table&quot;) ``` header=FALSE is to suppress the % Table created by stargazer header. This applies to only latex tables. label=\"tab:reg-table\" is to specify the cross reference label for the table. table.placement = \"H\" set float to H to fix positions. Places the float at precisely the location in the code. This requires the float LaTeX package. Remember to load it in the YAML. Defaults to \"!htbp\". The htbp controls where the table or figure is placed. Tables and figures do not need to go where you put them in the text. LATEX moves them around to prevent large areas of white space from appearing in your paper. h (Here): Place the float here, i.e., approximately at the same point it occurs in the source text (however, not exactly at the spot) t (Top): Place the table at the top of the current page b (Bottom): Place the table at the bottom of the current page. p (Page): Place the table at the top of the next page. !: Override internal parameters LaTeX uses for determining ‚Äúgood‚Äù float positions. notes.align \"l\" for left alignment, \"r\" for right alignment, and \"c\" for centering. This argument is not case-sensitive. single.row = TRUE to put coefficients and standard errors on same line no.space = TRUE to remove the spaces after each line of coefficients font.size = \"small\" to make font size smaller column.labels a character vector of labels for columns in regression tables. column.separate a numeric vector that specifies how column.labels should be laid out across regression table columns. A value of c(2, 1, 3), for instance, will apply the first label to the two first columns, the second label to the third column, and the third label will apply to the following three columns (i.e., columns number four, five and six). dep.var.labels and covariate.labels labels for dependant variables covariate.labels labels for covariates in the regression tables. Can provide latex symbols in the labels, need to escape special symbols though. stargazer(mod_sel_lm_mtcars, covariate.labels = c(&quot;(Intercept)&quot;, &quot;drat&quot;, &quot;hp&quot;, &quot;$w_{i}$&quot;, &quot;\\\\textit{k}&quot;, &quot;logLik&quot;, &quot;AICc&quot;, &quot;\\\\Delta AICc&quot;)) align=FALSE a logical value indicating whether numeric values in the same column should be aligned at the decimal mark in LaTeX output. add.lines add a row(s), such as reporting fixed effects. stargazer(output, output2, type = &quot;html&quot;, add.lines = list(c(&quot;Fixed effects?&quot;, &quot;No&quot;, &quot;No&quot;), c(&quot;Results believable?&quot;, &quot;Maybe&quot;, &quot;Try again later&quot;))) In html output, cross references to stargazer tables are not so straightforward. label option in stargazer does not work. Cannot use chunk labels either. ```{r fit-age, echo=FALSE, results=&#39;asis&#39;, fig.cap=&quot;Logistic regression of CHD on age.&quot;} # Use title caption from fig.cap tit &lt;- knitr::opts_current$get(&quot;fig.cap&quot;) # Adding caption for html output tit_html &lt;- paste0(&#39;&lt;span id=&quot;tab:&#39;, knitr::opts_current$get(&quot;label&quot;), &#39;&quot;&gt;(#tab:&#39;, knitr::opts_current$get(&quot;label&quot;), &#39;)&lt;/span&gt;&#39;, tit) stargazer::stargazer(fit.age, label = paste0(&quot;tab:&quot;, knitr::opts_current$get(&quot;label&quot;)), title = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(), tit, tit_html), type = ifelse(knitr::is_latex_output(),&quot;latex&quot;,&quot;html&quot;), notes = &quot;&lt;span&gt;&amp;#42;&lt;/span&gt;: p&lt;0.1; &lt;span&gt;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;strong&gt;p&lt;0.05&lt;/strong&gt;; &lt;span&gt;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&amp;#42;&lt;/span&gt;: p&lt;0.01 &lt;br&gt; Standard errors in the parentheses.&quot;, notes.append = F, header = F ) ``` Here is another reference to stargazer Table \\@ref(tab:fit-age). Don‚Äôt change things unless it is absolutely necessary. Run the code chunk before compiling the whole website. It gets slowly as the website gets larger. stargazer::stargazer() the :: is necessary, and header=F is necessary and should be place at the end, otherwise will have errors as follows. Error in `.stargazer.wrap()`: ! argument is missing, with no default Backtrace: 1. stargazer::stargazer(...) 2. stargazer:::.stargazer.wrap(...) Execution halted Exited with status 1.

Alignment of Stargazer Tables In PDF, the tables will be in the center by default. However, when working with HTML output, you need to add CSS styling to adjust the table. 3.10.4 kableExtra The kableExtra package is designed to extend the basic functionality of tables produced using knitr::kable(). kableExtra::kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c(\"striped\", \"hover\"), full_width = FALSE) bootstrap_options A character vector for bootstrap table options. Please see package vignette or visit the w3schools‚Äô Bootstrap Page for more information. Possible options include basic, striped, bordered, hover, condensed, responsive and none. striped alternating row colors hover Use the :hover selector on tr (table row) to highlight table rows on mouse over. full_width A TRUE or FALSE variable controlling whether the HTML table should have 100% the preferable format for full_width. If not specified, TRUE for a HTML table , will have full width by default but this option will be set to FALSE for a LaTeX table. latex_options A character vector for LaTeX table options, i.e., won‚Äôt have effecs on html tables. Possible options: Arguments Meanings striped Add alternative row colors to the table. It will imports LaTeX package xcolor if enabled. scale_down useful for super wide table. It will automatically adjust the table to fit the page width. repeat_header only meaningful in a long table environment. It will let the header row repeat on every page in that long table. hold_position ‚Äúhold‚Äù the floating table to the exact position. It is useful when the LaTeX table is contained in a table environment after you specified captions in kable(). It will force the table to stay in the position where it was created in the document. HOLD_position A stronger version of hold_position. Requires the float package and specifies ‚Å†[H]‚Å†. Rows and columns can be grouped via the functions pack_rows() and add_header_above(), respectively. scroll_box(width = \"100%\", height = \"500px\") let you create a fixed height table while making it scrollable.

Defaults to ‚Äúl‚Äù. Customize the looks for columns/rows kableExtra::column_spec(kable_input) this function allows users to select a column and then specify its look. row_spec() works similar with column_spec() but defines specifications for rows. For the position of the target row, you don‚Äôt need to count in header rows or the group labeling rows. row_spec(row = 0, align='c') specify format of the header row. Here I want to center align headers. Add header rows to group columns add_header_above(). The header variable is supposed to be a named character with the names as new column names and values as column span. For your convenience, if column span equals to 1, you can ignore the =1 part so the function below can be written as add_header_above(c(\"\", \"Group 1\" = 2, \"Group 2\" = 2, \"Group 3\" = 2)). kbl(dt) %&gt;% kable_classic() %&gt;% add_header_above(c(&quot; &quot; = 1, &quot;Group 1&quot; = 2, &quot;Group 2&quot; = 2, &quot;Group 3&quot; = 2)) You can add another row of header on top.

Use the Push and Pull buttons in RStudio as that‚Äôs easier than typing git push or git pull in the terminal. Project structure Note that the minimum requirement for any R Markdown website is that it have an index.Rmd file and a _site.yml file. If you execute the rmarkdown::render_site() function from within the directory containing the website, the following will occur: All of the *.Rmd and *.md files in the root website directory will be rendered into HTML. Note, however, that Markdown files beginning with _ are not rendered (this is a convention to designate files that are to be included by top level Rmd documents as child documents). index.Rmd controls the content on your main page. The generated HTML files and any supporting files (e.g., CSS and JavaScript) are copied into an output directory (_site by default, on Github Pages the output folder is docs). The HTML files within the output directory are now ready to deploy as a standalone static website. _site.yml config _site.yml is a configuration file. It contains various common elements you want to include on all pages (e.g., output options, CSS styles, header and footer elements, etc.). A _site.yml example: name: &quot;my-website&quot; output_dir: &quot;docs&quot; include: [&quot;import.R&quot;] exclude: [&quot;docs.txt&quot;, &quot;*.csv&quot;] output: html_document: theme: cosmo highlight: textmate include: after_body: footer.html css: styles.css name provides a suggested URL path for your website when it is published (by default this is just the name of the directory containing the site). output_dir field indicates which directory to copy site content into. \"_site\" is the default if none is specified. It can be \".\" to keep all content within the root website directory alongside the source code. The include and exclude fields enable you to override the default behavior vis-√†-vis what files are copied into the output directory. By default, all files within the website directory are copied into the output directory (e.g.¬†_site) except for the following: Files beginning with \".\" (hidden files). Files beginning with \"_\" Files known to contain R source code (e.g.¬†\".R\", \".s\", \".Rmd\"), R data (e.g.¬†\".RData\", \".rds\"), or configuration data (e.g.¬†\"rsconnect\" ,\"packrat\", \"renv\")). The include and exclude fields of _site.yml can be used to override this default behavior (wildcards can be used to specify groups of files to be included or excluded). Note that the include and exclude fields target only top-level files and directories (i.e.¬†a directory is either included or not, you can‚Äôt exclude a subset of files within a directory). Note also that include and exclude are not used to determine which Rmd files are rendered (all of them in the root directory save for those named with the _ prefix will be rendered). output defines shared output options for all R Markdown documents within a site. Note that individual documents can also include their own output options, which will be merged with the common options at render time. include: ¬†¬†¬†after-body: footer.html An example of footer.thml: &lt;p&gt;Copyright &amp;copy; 2016 Skynet, Inc. All rights reserved.&lt;/p&gt; style.css is a CSS stylesheet. blockquote { font-style: italic } R scripts If you have R code that you would like to share across multiple R Markdown documents within your site, you can create an R script (e.g., utils.R) and source it within your Rmd files. For example: ```{r} source(&quot;utils.R&quot;) ``` Shared Rmd snippets You may have common fragments of R Markdown that you want to share across pages within your site. To share Rmd fragments, you should name them with a leading underscore (_), and then include them within their parent Rmd document using the child chunk option. For example: about.Rmd: --- title: &quot;About This Website&quot; --- More about this website. ```{r, child=&quot;_session-info.Rmd&quot;} ``` _session-info.Rmd: Session information: ```{r} sessionInfo() ``` The leading underscore (_) is an indicator to the site generation engine that the Rmd is a partial document to be included in other documents, so it is not compiled as a standalone document during site rendering. Workflow Workflow: Edit your site, build it, then push and commit to GitHub to publish your changes online. To render all of the pages in the website, you use the Build pane, which calls rmarkdown::render_site() to build and then preview the entire site As you work on the individual pages of your website, you can render them using the Knit button just as you do with conventional standalone R Markdown documents. Or use the command line rmarkdown::render(\"0100-RStudio.Rmd\"). It will generate the html output RStudio.html in the same directory. You can see it in the Output pane &gt; Files tab. Click the file and choose View in Web Browser. If you want to have the pdf output, you add pdf_document to your document‚Äôs YAML after html_document. This way, your Rmd will supports multiple output format. When you click the Knit button of run rmarkdown::render(\"0100-RStudio.Rmd\"), it will use the first output format. You need to specify the output format you want in the second argument, call rmarkdown::render(\"0100-RStudio.Rmd\", 'pdf_document') More options can be passed by: render(&quot;0207-Rmd-Table.Rmd&quot;, bookdown::pdf_document2( latex_engine = &quot;lualatex&quot;, keep_tex = TRUE), output_options = list(includes(in_header = &quot;preamble.tex&quot;))) Note: Each time you run rmarkdown::render_site(), the docs/ folder will be overwritten with updated HTML versions of your .Rmds. This means DON‚ÄôT EVER EDIT FILES IN THE docs/ FOLDER! Nothing catastrophic will happen if you do, but you will overwrite and lose all your changes the next time you knit or render_site(). Don‚Äôt forget to update index.Rmd (home page) and _site.yml (cross references files include: [\"w1.rmd\", \"w2.rmd\"]) This will copy files into docs so that you can put a downloadable link to them. CSS Style --- output: html_document: theme: cosmo # css: style.css # link to external CSS --- &lt;style type = &quot;text/css&quot;&gt; h2 { color: red; /* internal CSS */ } &lt;/style&gt; ## R Markdown When you want to change the style of certain element but don‚Äôt know where to start, open the html in Chrome, and go to View &gt; Developer &gt; Inspect Element to identify the corresponding elements. Refer to your posts using relative links If you have a Markdown file in your repository at docs/project1.html, and you want to link from that file to docs/another-page.md, you can do so with the following markup: [a relative link](project1.html) When you view the source file on GitHub.com, the relative link will continue to work, but now, when you publish that file using GitHub Pages, the link will be silently translated to docs/another-page.html to match the target page‚Äôs published URL.

Rmd files: A typical bookdown book contains multiple chapters, and each chapter lives in one separate Rmd file. _bookdown.yml: A configuration file for bookdown. _output.yml: It specifies the formatting of the HTML, LaTeX/PDF, and e-books. preamble.tex and style.css: They can be used to adjust the appearance and styles of the book output document(s). Knowledge of LaTeX and/or CSS is required. These files are explained in greater detail in the following subsections. _output.yml _output.yml Output formats can be specified either in the YAML metadata of the first Rmd file of the book, or in a separate YAML file named _output.yml under the root directory of the book. See Section 12.4 in R Markdown: The Definitive Guide for a complete list of bookdown output formats. A quick takeaway is that bookdown supports both book types and single documents. Common uses of _output.yml: Add an edit link, e.g., https://github.com/my1396/R-Notes/edit/main/%s This will configure which remote repo to link to and hence allow the page to be downloadable as an .Rmd. Also need to specify download: [\"rmd\"]. Link to your GitHub in the toolbar (also need index.Rmd) Add other sharing links Header and footer of your TOC Collapse the TOC by (sub)section Code highlighting Here is a brief example of _output.yml: bookdown::gitbook: css: style.css highlight: tango split_by: section includes: in_header: head.html config: fontsettings: theme: sky toc: collapse: section+number before: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;./&quot;&gt;R Notes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; after: | &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown&quot; target=&quot;blank&quot;&gt;Published with bookdown&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; toc_depth: 3 edit: link: https://github.com/my1396/R-Notes/edit/main/%s sharing: github: yes download: [&quot;pdf&quot;, &quot;epub&quot;, &quot;rmd&quot;] enableEmoji: true bookdown::pdf_book: includes: in_header: preamble.tex latex_engine: xelatex citation_package: natbib keep_tex: yes bookdown::epub_book: default You do NOT need the three dashes --- in _output.yml. In this case, all formats should be at the top level, instead of under an output field in individual Rmds. split_by= c(\"chapter\", \"chapter+number\", \"section\", \"section+number\", \"rmd\", \"none\") defaults to chapter, which splits the file by the first-level headers. section splits the file by the second-level headers. chapter+number and section+number: the chapter/section numbers will be prepended to the HTML filenames. For example: if using chapter or section, the HTML file names will be introduction.html, literature.html, etc.; but with the numbering setting, the HTML file names will be 1-introduction.html, 2-literature.html, etc. I prefer section+number as it orders all html in the book‚Äôs section order. The includes option allows you to insert arbitrary custom content before and/or after the body of the output. It has three sub-options: in_header, before_body, and after_body. You need to know the basic structure of an HTML or LaTeX document to understand these options. The source of an HTML document looks like this: &lt;html&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;!-- head content here, e.g. CSS and JS --&gt; &lt;/head&gt; &lt;body&gt; &lt;!-- body content here --&gt; &lt;/body&gt; &lt;/html&gt; The in_header option takes a file path and inserts it into the &lt;head&gt; tag. The before_body file will be inserted right below the opening &lt;body&gt; tag, and after_body is inserted before the closing tag &lt;/body&gt;. A LaTeX source document has a similar structure: \\documentclass{book} % LaTeX preamble % insert in_header here \\begin{document} % insert before_body here % body content here % insert after_body here \\end{document} You can add a **table of contents* using the toc option and specify the depth of headers that it applies to using the toc_depth option. If the TOC depth defaults to 3 in html_document. For pdf_document, if the TOC depth is not explicitly specified, it defaults to 2 (meaning that all level 1 and 2 headers will be included in the TOC). --- bookdown::gitbook: toc: collapse: subsection toc_depth: 3 --- collapse specifies a level to expand to by default, aka at #, ##, or ###. I suggest ollapsing at level 2. This way, you get a good overview of what each major topic (level 1 heading) includes, without showing the most detailed items. collapse: subsection: At startup, the toc will collapse at the level 2 headings. As you go to one specific subsection, the content inside will expand. You can see level 3 headings. ‚úÖ collapse: section: At startup, the toc will collapse at the level 1 headings, which keeps the appearance concise. However, a side effect is that level 3 headings will never be displaied when navigating to a specific level 2 heading. bookdown ‰∏≠Êñá‰π¶Á±ç _output.yml ËåÉ‰æã: https://github.com/yihui/bookdown-chinese/blob/96d526572f0c6648d06c2d4bebf57c5fb4eafce3/_output.yml You can set up a tex template.

After you serve your site locally, all supporting files will be output to docs. Be sure to add one .nojekyll file in docs to tell GitHub that your website is not to be built via Jekyll. Because bookdown only overwrites existing files and does not delete unused ones, you can simply delete the docs folder so that bookdown will recreate everything necessary without any redundancy. Remember to recreate .nojekyll too after bookdown has created the new docs. index.Rmd index.Rmd homepage of your website.

Within any .Rmd Chapters (also sections) are based on separate Rmd files. Besides index.Rmd, other R Markdown files will make up the chapters of your book. By default, bookdown merges all Rmd files by the order of filenames, e.g., 01-intro.Rmd will appear before 02-literature.Rmd. "],["4.2-rendering-bookdown.html", "4.2 Rendering bookdown", " 4.2 Rendering bookdown Two approaches: ‚ÄúMerge and Knit‚Äù (M-K): default; runs all code chunks in all chapters; the state of the R session from previous chapters is carried over to later chapters (e.g., objects created in previous chapters are available to later chapters, unless you deliberately deleted them) ‚ÄúKnit and Merge‚Äù (K-M): separate R sessions for individual chapters; all chapters are isolated from each other. Other differences: Because knitr does not allow duplicate chunk labels in a source document, you need to make sure there are no duplicate labels in your book chapters when you use the M-K approach, otherwise knitr will signal an error when knitting the merged Rmd file. Note that this means there must not be duplicate labels throughout the whole book. The K-M approach only requires no duplicate labels within any single Rmd file. K-M does not allow Rmd files to be in subdirectories, but M-K does. To switch to K-M, you either use the argument new_session = TRUE when calling render_book(), or set new_session: yes in the configuration file _bookdown.yml. Everytime you make changes to individual Rmd files or to CSS style files, you can knit the single page using rmarkdown::render(\"0100-RStudio.Rmd\") or the Knit button in the source editor. The change will be reflected to your website. This is faster than Build the website.

"],["6-machine-learning.html", "Chapter 6 Machine Learning", " Chapter 6 Machine Learning Parametric models such as generalized linear regression and logistic regression has advantages and disadvantages. Strength: The effects of individual predictors on the outcome are easily understood Statistical inference, such as hypothesis testing or interval estimation, is straightforward Methods and procedures for selecting, comparing, and summarizing these models are well-established and extensively studied Disadvantages in the following scenarios: Complex, non-linear relationships between predictors and the outcome High degrees of interaction between predictors Nominal outcome variables with several categories In these situations, non-parametric or algorithmic modeling approaches have the potential to better capture the underlying trends in the data. Here we introduce three models: classification and regression trees (CART), random forests, k-nearest neighbors. Classification and regression trees (CART) are ‚Äútrained‚Äù by recursively partitioning the ùëù-dimensional space (defined by the explanatory variables) until an acceptable level of homogeneity or ‚Äúpurity‚Äù is achieved within each partition. A major issue with tree-based models is that they tend to be high variance (leading to a high propensity towards over-fitting). Random forests are a non-parametric, tree-based modeling algorithm that is built upon the idea that averaging a set of independent elements yields an outcome with lower variability than any of the individual elements in the set. This general concept should seem familiar. Thinking back to your introductory statistics course, you should remember that the sample mean, \\(\\overline{x}\\), of a dataset has substantially less variability (\\(\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}}\\)) than the individual data-points themselves (\\(\\sigma\\)). Q: What is Bias-Variance Trade-Off in Machine Learning? A: Bias refers to error caused by a model for solving complex problems that is over simplified, makes significant assumptions, and misses important relationships in your data. Variance error is variability of a target function‚Äôs form with respect to different training sets. Models with small variance error will not change much if you replace couple of samples in training set. Models with high variance might be affected even with small changes in training set. High variance models fit the data too well, and learns the noise in addition to the inherent patterns in the data. "],["6.1-random-forest.html", "6.1 Random Forest", " 6.1 Random Forest Averaging of independent trees The goal of bagging is to produce \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) separate training datasets that are independent of each other (typically ùêµ is in the hundreds). The model of interest (in this case classification and regression trees) is trained separately on each of these datasets, resulting in \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) different estimated ‚Äúmodels‚Äù. These are then averaged to produce a single, low-variance estimate. Bagging is a general approach, but its most well-known application is in the random forest algorithm: Construct \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) bootstrap samples by sampling cases from the original dataset with replacement (this results in \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) unique datasets that are similar to the original) Fit a classification and regression tree to each sample, but randomly choose a subset of \\(m\\) variables that can be used in the construction of that tree (this results in \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) unique trees that are fit to similar datasets using different sets of predictors) For a given data-point, each of the \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\) trees in the forest contributes a prediction or ‚Äúvote‚Äù, with the majority (or average) of these votes forming the random forest‚Äôs final prediction, \\(\\hat{y}_i\\) knitr::include_graphics(&quot;images/rf.png&quot;) A downside of both the CART and random forest algorithms (as well as many other algorithmic modeling approaches) is an inability to clearly quantify the roles played by individual variables in making predictions. However, the importance of individual variables in a random forest can still be expressed using a measure known as variable importance. The random forest algorithm requires the following tuning parameters be specified in order to run: ntree - the number of bagged samples, \\(\\boldsymbol{B}\\), onto which trees will be grown mtry - the number of variables that are randomly chosen to be candidates at each split Some sort of stopping criteria for individual trees, this can be: nodesize, which sets the minimum size of terminal nodes larger nodesize leads to shallower trees smaller node size allows for deeper, more complex trees maxnodes, which sets the maximum number of terminal nodes an individual tree can have. Applications of Random Forest Some of the applications of Random Forest Algorithm are listed below: Banking: It predicts a loan applicant‚Äôs solvency. This helps lending institutions make a good decision on whether to give the customer loan or not. They are also being used to detect fraudsters. Health Care: Health professionals use random forest systems to diagnose patients. Patients are diagnosed by assessing their previous medical history. Past medical records are reviewed to establish the proper dosage for the patients. Stock Market: Financial analysts use it to identify potential markets for stocks. It also enables them to remember the behaviour of stocks. E-Commerce: Through this system, e-commerce vendors can predict the preference of customers based on past consumption behaviour. When to Avoid Using Random Forests? Random Forests Algorithms are not ideal in the following situations: Extrapolation: Random Forest regression is not ideal in the extrapolation of data. Unlike linear regression, which uses existing observations to estimate values beyond the observation range. Sparse Data: Random Forest does not produce good results when the data is sparse. In this case, the subject of features and bootstrapped sample will have an invariant space. This will lead to unproductive spills, which will affect the outcome. FAQ Q: Is RF a linear or non-linear model? A: RF can capture complex, non-linear relationships. Q: Is RF sensitive to Imbalanced Data? A: Yes. It may perform poorly if the dataset is highly imbalanced like one class is significantly more frequent than another. Q: What is the loss function? A: Entropy/gini or any other loss function you want. Q: Difference btw RF and a linear model? A: A major difference is that a decision tree does not have ‚Äúparameters‚Äù, whereas the linear models need to create a functional form and find the optimal parameters. Implementation in R ranger package offers a computation efficient function for RF. RF_ranger &lt;- ranger(formula = formula, data = data_before[idx,], probability = TRUE, importance = &quot;permutation&quot;, scale.permutation.importance = TRUE, ) # print(RF_ranger) rf.pred.test &lt;- predict(RF_ranger, data=data_before[-idx,])$predictions Parameters controlling the general process of RF: probability=FALSE: Whether to forecast a probability forest. The hyperparameters mtry, min.node.size and sample.fraction determine the degree of randomness, and should be tuned. mtry=500: Number of variables to possibly split at in each node in one tree. In plain language, it indicates how many predictor variables should be used in each tree. Default is the (rounded down) square root of the number variables. Alternatively, a single argument function returning an integer, given the number of independent variables. Range btw 1 to the number of predictors. If all predictors are used, then this corresponds in fact to bagging. min.node.size: The number of observations a terminal node should at least have. Default 1 for classification, 5 for regression, 3 for survival, and 10 for probability. For classification, this can be a vector of class-specific values. Range between 1 and 10 sample.fraction: Fraction of observations to be used in each tree. Default is 1 for sampling with replacement and 0.632 for sampling without replacement. For classification, this can be a vector of class-specific values. Smaller fractions lead to greater diversity, and thus less correlated trees which often is desirable. Range between 0.2 and 0.9 Parameters controlling what and how intermediate results are saved: keep.inbag = FALSE: Whether to save how often observations are in-bag in each tree. Set to TRUE if you want to check sample composition in each tree. importance = 'none'|'impurity'|'impurity_corrected'|'permutation': Variable importance mode. scale.permutation.importance = FALSE: Whether to scale permutation importance by standard error as in (Breiman 2001). Only applicable if 'permutation' variable importance mode selected. write.forest = TRUE: Whether to save ranger.forest object, required for prediction. Set to FALSE to reduce memory usage if no prediction intended. Set to FALSE when you do parameter tuning. Q: How to tune hyperparameters? A: Check out mlr3 package. Here is an example.
