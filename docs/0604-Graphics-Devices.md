## Control Graphics Devices

`dev.cur()`	returns a length-one named integer vector giving the number and name of the active device, or 1, the null device, if none is active.

`dev.new()` 	opens a new `RStudioGD` device. 

**`dev.list()`**   returns the numbers of all open devices, except device 1, the null device. 

- This is a numeric vector with a `names` attribute giving the device names, or `NULL` is there is no open device.
- Usually `2` is `RStudioGD 2`. 

**`dev.set(which = dev.next())`** 	makes the specified device the active device. If there is no device with that number, it is equivalent to `dev.next`. If `which = 1` it opens a new device and selects that.

`dev.prev(which = dev.cur())`  `dev.next` and `dev.prev` select the next/previous open device in the appropriate direction, unless no device is open.

`dev.off(which = dev.cur()) `  shuts down the specified (by default the current) device.

**`graphics.off()`** 	shuts down all open graphics devices. 



**Save the current graphic object**

```R
library(grid)
grab <- grid.grab()
ggsave(grab, filename = f_name, width=10.9, height=5.82)
```

- `pdf` device uses inches to specify width and height.
- `png` and `jpeg` use pixels to specify dimensions.


### Save PNG

```r
plot_png <- function(p, f_name, width, height, ppi=300){
    # a plot wrapper
    png(f_name, width=width*ppi, height=height*ppi, res=ppi)
    print (p)
    dev.off()
}
```

- Sometimes the title got cut off. You can change `oma` to add more top margin. 
  - If it doesn't help, change the dimension of your figure, make it higher by changing the height of the figure output.
  - `par(oma=c(bottom, left, top, right))` only works for base-R graphics; use `theme(plot.margin = margin(t=7, b=7, r=12, l=7, unit="pt") )` to add more margins to `ggplot` object.

- You can check the dimension of your figure by right-click on the plot, then "Copy Image Address", paste the address somewhere, you get the width and height information in the address. You can use this aspect ratio as a start.
  - unit: px.

- Don't make the figure too big as the title, axis ticks, will become too small to see in proportion.





**Forward display**

`x11()` opens an interactive graphics device. `x11` is Apple's X server. It is reliable and provides hardware OpenGL acceleration. 

https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/grDevices/versions/3.6.2/topics/x11

https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/downloads/1.11.2/mac_x11.html

When you are using a native Mac application (not X windows) and then click on a menu within the X window, <span class="env-green">the mouse click does not bring up the menu</span>. It just activates the X window and another mouse click is needed to show the menu. <u>To make this work with a single mouse click</u>, use the Mac X server `wm_click_through` preference by typing the following command in a Mac Terminal window:

`defaults write org.x.x11 wm_click_through -bool true`  Disables the default behavior of swallowing window-activating mouse events.

-   Normally Mac OS X swallows window-activating mouse events. This preference causes a window-activating mouse click on an X window to also be processed by the application.
-   X11 must be <span class="env-green">restarted</span> after any of these settings are changed. The settings are saved in your `~/Library/Preferences/org.x.x11.plist` file, so they will apply to future sessions. Reissuing the commands with false instead of true will restore the default preference settings.

>   An item that provides <span class="env-green">click-through</span> is one that a user can activate with one click, even though the item is in an inactive window. (To activate an item that does not support click-through, the user must first make the containing window active and then click the item.) Although click-through can make some user tasks easier, it can also confuse users if they click items unintentionally.

For the Quartz device, you can use `quartzFonts()` to see what the default font for each of these keywords is

```R
quartzFonts()
# $serif
# [1] "Times-Roman"      "Times-Bold"       "Times-Italic"     "Times-BoldItalic"
# 
# $sans
# [1] "Helvetica"             "Helvetica-Bold"        "Helvetica-Oblique"     "Helvetica-BoldOblique"
# 
# $mono
# [1] "Courier"             "Courier-Bold"        "Courier-Oblique"     "Courier-BoldOblique"

```

Font support in R is generally not very good. It varies between systems, and between output formats.

Sometimes what you see on the screen isnâ€™t necessarily the same as what you get when you output to PNG or PDF. 

PNG output has less suport for font variety; PDF has better support.
