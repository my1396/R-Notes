Q: How to print output in console rather than inline in Rmd?

A: Choose the gear ‚öôÔ∏è in the editor toolbar and choose "Chunk Output in Console".

Q: How to insert Emojis in Rmd?

A: There are several options:

- You can type directly a lot of Emojis, such as Ô∏èüôè and ü§£. Try this first, if it doesn't show properly, then try the following solutions.
    - If the emoji can show in the script, then you can use it directly.

- Using a html tag, e.g., `<span> ‚öôÔ∏è </span>` will show like this 

    <p><span> ‚öôÔ∏è </span> <p>
    
    This seems to be the most straightforward solution to me. ‚úÖ
    
    Note that the emoji won't disply correctly in your Rmd file, but when you render the Rmd and deploy to html pages, the emoji will show properly. 
    
- Using Hexadecimal code. (You need to look up the code somewhere, which is a hassle. ‚ùå)

    We can add emojis to an HTML document by using their hexadecimal code. These code starts with `&#x` and ends with `;` to specify browser that these are hexadecimal codes. For example,
    
    ```html
    <p>Smily face <span>&#x1F600;</span> </p>
    ```
    will give you
    
    Smily face <span>&#x1F600;</span>
    
    Go to this site: https://emojipedia.org/emoji/

    Grab the **codepoint** for the emoji you want (e.g., `U+1F600` for grinning face)

    Replace `U+` with `&#x` so it becomes `&#x1F600`, and add a semicolon `;` at the end.

    Finally, enclose that into an html tag, e.g., `<span>`.

- With RStudio Visual mode. (You need to change mode back and forth. ‚ùå)

    First change to the Visual mode. To insert an emoji, you can use either the `Insert` menu or the requisite markdown shortcut plus auto-complete: <img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=19LXy8c4h2XzlSELBLCPPvOGHeKvjIDPx&amp;sz=w1000" alt="Visual Mode Emojis" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;"/>
    
    I am personally NOT a fan of Visual Mode because it changes your source code silently ‚Ä¶



------------------------------------------------------------------------

[**Set working directory**]{style="color:#008B45FF"}

``` r
# get the dir name of the current script
dir_folder <- dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path) 
setwd(dir_folder) # set as working dir
```

RStudio projects are associated with R working directories. You can create an RStudio project:

-   In a brand new directory
-   In an existing directory where you already have R code and data
-   By cloning a version control (Git or Subversion) repository

Why using R projects:

1.  I don't need to use `setwd` at the start of each script, and if I move the base project folder it will still work.
2.  I have a personal package with a custom project, which creates my folders just the way I like them. This makes it so that the basic locations for data, outputs and analysis is the same across my work.

Double-click on a `.Rproj` file to open a fresh instance of RStudio, with the working directory and file browser pointed at the project folder.

Q: What is an **R session**? And when do I use it?

A: Multiple concurrent sessions can be useful when you want to:

-   Run multiple analyses in parallel
-   Keep multiple sessions open indefinitely
-   Participate in one or more [shared projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/211659737)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Launch a new project-less RStudio session**

``` r
# run in console
rstudioapi::terminalExecute("open -n /Applications/RStudio.app", show = FALSE)
```

`-n` Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already running.

`rstudioapi::terminalExecute(command, workingDir = NULL, env = character(), show = TRUE)` tells R to run the system command in quotes.

-   `command` System command to be invoked, as a character string.
-   `workingDir` Working directory for command
-   `env` Vector of name=value strings to set environment variables
-   `show` If FALSE, terminal won't be brought to front

The [`rstudioapi`]{style="color:#008B45FF"} package provides an interface for interacting with the RStudio IDE with R code. Using`rstudioapi`, you can:

-   Examine, manipulate, and save the contents of documents currently open in RStudio,
-   Create, open, or re-open RStudio projects,
-   Prompt the user with different kinds of dialogs (e.g. for selecting a file or folder, or requesting a password from the user),
-   Interact with RStudio terminals,
-   Interact with the R session associated with the current RStudio instance.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Set up Development Tools**

<https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/>

-   install Xcode command line tools

    ``` bash
    sudo xcode-select --install
    ```

-   install GNU Fortran compiler

    Using **Apple silicon** (aka arm64, aarch64, M1) Macs Fortran compiler

-   Go to <https://www.xquartz.org/>, download the .dmg and run the installer.

-   Verify that build tools are installed and available by opening an R console and running

    ``` r
    install.packages("pkgbuild")
    pkgbuild::check_build_tools()
    ```

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Insert Code Session**

To insert a new code section you can use the **Code** -\> **Insert Section** command. Alternatively, any comment line which includes at least four trailing dashes (`-`), equal signs (`=`), or pound signs (`#`) automatically creates a code section.

**Define your own shortcuts**

<https://www.statworx.com/ch/blog/defining-your-own-shortcut-in-rstudio/>

<https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/03/defining-your-own-shortcut-in-rstudio/>

Install the shortcut packages.

Add code session separators, `---` or `===`.

``` r
install.packages(
    # same path as above
  "~/Downloads/shoRtcut_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
  # indicate it is a local file
  repos = NULL)
install.packages(
    # same path as above
  "~/Downloads/shoRtcut2_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
  # indicate it is a local file
  repos = NULL)
```

Now go to Tools \> Modify Keyboard Shortcuts and search for "dashes". Here you can define the keyboard combination by clicking inside the empty Shortcut field and pressing the desired key-combination on your keyboard. Click Apply, and that's it!

**Tips and Tricks**

- To add comments to a function, you can type ‚ÄúRoxygen comment‚Äù into the Command Palette (‚áß+‚åò+P) while the cursor is in a function and it will automatically add a template structure for writing a comment about your function.

  Keyboard shortcut: ‚áß‚å•‚åòR

- Snippets are a way to make a shortcut for inserting text based on a ‚Äúcode‚Äù.

  To find the snippets and edit them, use the Palette (`Cmd-Shift-P`) and type ‚Äúedit snippets‚Äù. There you will find some predefined snippets. You can also create your own.

  For instance, when in an R script (or code chunk), typing ‚Äúfun‚Äù followed by pressing `Tab`, a template for a function will be inserted that looks like:

  ```r
  name <- function(variables) {
      
  }
  ```

  You can just fill in the name of the function, then press `Tab` to move to the variables, change the name, then press `Tab` again to move to the function code area and write your function without moving your fingers from the keyboard.

- Show argument definitions as you type functions.

  When you type an existing R function such as `round(`, not only does `tab` give you the options, but there's an explanation beneath each variable, telling you its role in the function:
