<span style='color:#32CD32'>**`Rmd` related**</span>

Q: How to print output in console rather than inline in Rmd?

A: Choose the gear in the editor toolbar and choose "Chunk Output in Console".

<img src="https://drive.google.com/thumbnail?id=1YJhzqrr4lIULXKQ-TeTHBcmR5Q-49gFe&sz=w1000" alt="output to console" style="display: block; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; zoom:80%;" />



<span style='color:#32CD32'>**Set working directory**</span>

```R
dir_folder <- dirname(rstudioapi::getSourceEditorContext()$path) # get the dir name of the current script
setwd(dir_folder) # set as working dir
```

RStudio projects are associated with R working directories. You can create an RStudio project:

- In a brand new directory
- In an existing directory where you already have R code and data
- By cloning a version control (Git or Subversion) repository



Why using R projects:

1. I don't need to use `setwd` at the start of each script, and if I move the base project folder it will still work.
2. I have a personal package with a custom project, which creates my folders just the way I like them. This makes it so that the basic locations for data, outputs and analysis is the same across my work.



Double-click on a `.Rproj` file to open a fresh instance of RStudio, with the working directory and file browser pointed at the project folder.



Q: What is an **R session**? And when do I use it?

A: Multiple concurrent sessions can be useful when you want to:

- Run multiple analyses in parallel
- Keep multiple sessions open indefinitely
- Participate in one or more [shared projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/211659737)



**Lauch a new project-less RStudio session**

```r
# run in console
rstudioapi::terminalExecute("open -n /Applications/RStudio.app", show = FALSE)
```

`-n`  Open a new instance of the application(s) even if one is already running.

`rstudioapi::terminalExecute(command, workingDir = NULL, env = character(), show = TRUE)` tells R to run the system command in quotes.

- `command` 	System command to be invoked, as a character string.
- `workingDir`   Working directory for command
- `env`                  Vector of name=value strings to set environment variables
- `show`                If FALSE, terminal won't be brought to front

The <span style='color:#32CD32'>`rstudioapi`</span> package provides an interface for interacting with the RStudio IDE with R code. Using`rstudioapi`, you can:

- Examine, manipulate, and save the contents of documents currently open in RStudio,
- Create, open, or re-open RStudio projects,
- Prompt the user with different kinds of dialogs (e.g. for selecting a file or folder, or requesting a password from the user),
- Interact with RStudio terminals,
- Interact with the R session associated with the current RStudio instance.

**Set up Development Tools** 

https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/tools/

- install Xcode command line tools

  ```bash
  sudo xcode-select --install
  ```

- install GNU Fortran compiler

  Using **Apple silicon** (aka arm64, aarch64, M1) Macs Fortran compiler

- Go to https://www.xquartz.org/, download the .dmg and run the installer.

- Verify that build tools are installed and available by opening an R console and running

  ```R
  install.packages("pkgbuild")
  pkgbuild::check_build_tools()
  ```

**Insert Code Session**

To insert a new code section you can use the **Code** -> **Insert Section** command. Alternatively, any comment line which includes at least four trailing dashes (`-`), equal signs (`=`), or pound signs (`#`) automatically creates a code section. 

**Define your own shortcuts**

https://www.statworx.com/ch/blog/defining-your-own-shortcut-in-rstudio/

https://www.r-bloggers.com/2020/03/defining-your-own-shortcut-in-rstudio/

Install the shortcut packages.

Add code session separators, `---` or `===`.

```R
install.packages(
    # same path as above
  "~/Downloads/shoRtcut_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
  # indicate it is a local file
  repos = NULL)
install.packages(
    # same path as above
  "~/Downloads/shoRtcut2_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
  # indicate it is a local file
  repos = NULL)
```

Now go to Tools > Modify Keyboard Shortcuts and search for "dashes". Here you can define the keyboard combination by clicking inside the empty Shortcut field and pressing the desired key-combination on your keyboard. Click Apply, and that’s it!

## Dark Theme

https://community.rstudio.com/t/fvaleature-req-word-background-highlight-color-in-find-and-spellcheck/18578/3

https://rstudio.github.io/rstudio-extensions/rstudio-theme-creation.html

https://docs.posit.co/ide/user/ide/guide/ui/appearance.html#creating-custom-themes-for-rstudio

`.ace_marker-layer .ace_selection` Changes the color and style of the highlighting for the currently selected line or block of lines.

`.ace_marker-layer .ace_bracket`   Changes the color and style of the highlighting on matching brackets.

**Recommended highlight color**: `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.47)`



`RStudio` editor theme directory on Mac:

right click `RStudio.app`, "Show Package Contents" to navigate to the application folder. 

`/Applications/RStudio.app/Contents/Resources/resources/themes/ambiance.rstheme`

Custom theme (user-defined) folder: 

- `~/.config/rstudio/themes/idle_fingers_2.rstheme` on mac
- [viridis-theme](https://github.com/z3tt/viridis-theme/blob/main/viridis.rstheme)

```scss
/* yaml tag */
.ace_meta.ace_tag {
  color: #2499DA;
}
/* quoted by $...$ and code chunk options */
.ace_support.ace_function {
  color: #55C667;
}
```

## Packages Management

**Install R pakages from source**

```R
# From local tarball
install.packages(
  # indicate path of the package source file
  "~/Documents/R/UserPackages/shoRtcut2_0.1.0.tar.gz", 
  # indicate it is a local file
  repos = NULL)

# From github
install.packages("Rcpp", repos="https://rcppcore.github.io/drat")
```



Check insatlled packages

```R
# print all installed packages
rownames(installed.packages())
# check if `ggplot2` is installed
"ggplot2" %in% rownames(installed.packages())
```

Update packages

```R
packageVersion("ggplot2") # check package version
install.packages("ggplot2") # update one specific package

## update all installed packages in a stated library location, default to `.libPaths()`
update.packages(lib.loc = .libPaths()) 
```

Which will ask you for every package if you want to update, to just say yes to everything use `ask = FAlSE`.

```R
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
```

Unfortunately this <span style='color:#32CD32'>won’t</span> update packages installed by `devtools::install_github()`

**Updating all Packages after <span style='color:cyan'>R update</span>**

R packages are missing after updating. So have to save the installed packages and re-install them after updating.

```R
## get packages installed
packs <- as.data.frame(installed.packages(.libPaths()[1]), stringsAsFactors = F)
# Save to local
f_name <- "~/Documents/R/packages.csv"
rownames(packs)
write.csv(packs, f_name, row.names = FALSE)
packs <- read_csv(f_name)
packs
## Re-install packages using install.packages() after updating R
install.packages(packs$Package)
```

R library path `/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2-arm64/Resources/library`

-   use `find.package("ggplot2")` to find the location of the source file.
-   alternatively, `.libPaths()` 
    -   returns the directory within which packages are looked for.



`library(package)` returns an error if the package doesn't exist.

`require(package)` returns `FALSE` if the package doesn't exist. `require` is designed for use inside other functions.

### Put your R package on GitHub

https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session2.4_github.html

- Change to the package directory

- Initialize the repository with `git init`

- Add and commit everything with

  1.   `git add .`              stage changes;
  2.   `git status`            optional check staged changes, but yet to submit;
  3.   and `git commit`    submit staged changes.

- Create a [new repository on GitHub](https://github.com/new)

- Connect your local repository to the GitHub one

  ```git
  git remote add origin https://github.com/username/reponame
  ```

- Push everything to github

  ```git
  git branch -M main
  git push -u origin main
  ```
