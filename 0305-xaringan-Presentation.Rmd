## xaringan Presentation

It is a slide template based on an HTML5 presentation framework `remark.js`.

You write slides in R Markdown, and then use the `xaringan` package to render the slides.

Features:

- Interactive like html notes, but in form of slides, making it equivalent to PowerPoint, which students are more used to.

- Support the choice of Google fonts.
